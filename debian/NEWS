cron (3.0pl1-110) unstable; urgency=low

    In the past, long-running jobs caused certain MTAs to time out,
    resulting in no output being sent. Justin Pryzby's patch to fix this
    has been included.

    crontab(1) now refuses any crontabs missing a newline before EOF.

    cron(8) now recovers from broken symlinks in /etc/cron.d. This fix
    may cause power management issues (disk spin-ups), feedback welcome.

cron (3.0pl1-74) unstable; urgency=low

    The checksecurity script is no longer included with the cron package:
    it now has its own package, "checksecurity". If you liked the
    functionality provided with that script, please install the new
    package.
